## Model Overview and Notations

### AR(1) Cholesky Decomposition

In the model, the temporal autocorrelation structure of the random effects is modeled using an AR(1) process. The AR(1) model defines the correlation between time periods \( t \) and \( t' \) as:

\[
\text{AR1}_{t, t'} = \rho^{|t - t'|}
\]

Where:
- \( \rho \) is the autocorrelation parameter between consecutive time periods.

To generate correlated random effects, we use the Cholesky decomposition of the AR(1) matrix. This decomposition transforms uncorrelated random effects into correlated random effects. The Cholesky factor \( \mathbf{T}_L \) satisfies:

\[
\mathbf{AR1} = \mathbf{T}_L \mathbf{T}_L^T
\]

Where:
- \( \mathbf{T}_L \) is the lower triangular matrix obtained from the Cholesky decomposition.

The Stan function `AR1_L` computes the Cholesky decomposition of the AR(1) matrix. It fills in the diagonal elements with \( \sqrt{1 - \rho^2} \) and uses the recursive relation \( \rho \cdot \mathbf{ar1\_mat\_L}[i-1,j] \) for the off-diagonal elements.

This allows the model to incorporate temporal correlation between random effects, reflecting the autocorrelation structure defined by \( \rho \).


#### Cholesky Decomposition of AR1 Matrix

We begin by defining the Cholesky decomposition of the AR(1) correlation matrix as follows:

\[
\mathbf{T}_L = \text{AR1}_L(T, \rho)
\]

Where:
- \( \rho \) is the temporal autocorrelation parameter (between 0 and 1).
- \( \mathbf{T}_L \) is the Cholesky decomposition of the AR1 matrix for \( T \) time periods.

#### Expected Case Rates

\[
\lambda_{i,t} = \exp(\beta_0 + \theta_i + \eta_{i,t}) \cdot \text{pop}_{i,t}
\]

Where:
- \( \lambda_{i,t} \) is the expected disease rate for county \( i \) and month \( t \),
- \( \beta_0 \) is the global intercept representing the base log-rate of disease,
- \( \theta_i \) is the random effect for county \( i \), capturing county-specific deviations from the global intercept,
- \( \eta_{i,t} \) is the transformed random effect for each county and month,
- \( \text{pop}_{i,t} \) is the population or average cases for county \( i \) and month \( t \).

#### Observed Cases

\[
Y_{i,t} \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_{i,t})
\]

Where:
- \( Y_{i,t} \) is the observed case count for county \( i \) and month \( t \),
- \( \lambda_{i,t} \) is the expected disease rate for county \( i \) and month \( t \), as defined above.

#### Priors

\[
\beta_0 \sim \text{Normal}(0, 2), \quad \theta_{\text{raw},i} \sim \text{Normal}(0, 1), \quad \sigma \sim \text{Normal}(1, 2), \quad \rho \sim \text{Beta}(2, 2)
\]

Where:
- \( \beta_0 \) is the global intercept,
- \( \theta_{\text{raw},i} \) are the raw random effects for each county, defined as non-centered random effects,
- \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation of the random effects,
- \( \rho \) is the temporal autocorrelation parameter, governing the correlation of disease rates over time.

#### Generated Quantities (Posterior Predictive)

\[
Y_{\text{hat},i,t} \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_{i,t})
\]

Where:
- \( Y_{\text{hat},i,t} \) are the posterior predictive case counts for county \( i \) and month \( t \).
