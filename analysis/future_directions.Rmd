## Expanding Toward Surveillance Optimization

While the current model focuses on predicting COVID-19 case counts at the county level, future directions include optimizing surveillance strategies â€” particularly incorporating wastewater data and using the DIOS (Decision-Informed Optimal Surveillance) framework.

### Wastewater Integration (Planned)

We plan to model wastewater signals as indirect observations of the same latent prevalence \( \lambda_{i,t} \). A zero-inflated Gamma distribution may be used:

$$
W_{i,t} \sim p \cdot \text{Gamma}(\kappa_i^{-2}, a \cdot \kappa_i^2 \cdot \text{pop}_{i,t} \cdot \lambda_{i,t}) + (1-p)\delta_0
$$

This enables joint modeling of clinical case counts and environmental surveillance for stronger estimation and forecasting.

## Decision-Informed Optimal Surveillance (DIOS)

DIOS provides a framework to guide **where and how to place surveillance resources** using statistical models and decision-theoretic loss functions.

### ðŸ›  Design Parameters
- Choosing which counties to test (sampled counties)
- Deciding how many tests to allocate per county (equal vs. population-based)
- Setting outbreak detection rules (e.g., daily cases > 5 and % change > 100%)

### ðŸ“‰ Operational Constraints
- Total tests available per day (e.g., 5,000)
- Ensuring valid test results (no negative values)
- Balanced allocations respecting population or uniformity

### ðŸŽ¯ Surveillance Objectives

#### 1. **Minimize Outbreak Detection Delay**
Reduce the lag between outbreak start and detection time.

$$
f = E[T_{detected} - T_{outbreak}]
$$

Where:
- \( T_{outbreak} \): Outbreak start from observed data
- \( T_{detected} \): Detection time based on adjusted or simulated cases

---

#### 2. **Minimize Estimation Error**
Evaluate how far predicted cases deviate from true case counts:

$$
f = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (CI_i - CD_i)^2
$$

Where \( CI_i \) is the estimated count and \( CD_i \) the true count for county \( i \).

---

#### 3. **Minimize Uncertainty in Estimands**
Focuses on reducing variance in estimates of key targets like peaks or total cases:

$$
f = \text{Var}(P_I)
$$

Where \( P_I \) is the predicted peak.

---

#### 4. **Maximize Classification Accuracy**
Optimize outbreak classification performance using ROC metrics:

$$
f = \int_0^1 \pi_{tp}(p_{fp}) \, dp_{fp}
$$

Where:
- \( \pi_{tp} \): True positive rate
- \( p_{fp} \): False positive rate

---

#### 5. **Maximize Allocation Efficiency**
Optimize the value of each test based on the county population and estimated case yield:

$$
f = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{\text{Allocated Tests}_i}{\text{Population}_i} \cdot \log(1 + CI_i) \right)
$$

## Summary

This direction will connect predictive modeling with surveillance system design. Future work will integrate Bayesian inference, stochastic simulation, and optimization to enhance early outbreak detection and response across South Carolina.
