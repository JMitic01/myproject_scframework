## South Carolina COVID-19 Data Set Analysis

We analyze daily COVID-19 case and death counts at the county level across South Carolina.  
The data were collected from March 6, 2020, to July 23, 2023, and were processed to derive daily new counts from the cumulative totals originally reported.

## Data Structure

The dataset contains **56,166 rows** and **8 columns**:

- `Date`: The reporting date (daily frequency)
- `County`: County name within South Carolina
- `Population`: Estimated county population
- `Cases`: Cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases
- `Deaths`: Cumulative number of reported deaths
- `Hospitalizations`: Reported hospitalizations (frequently missing)
- `daily_cases`: Computed daily new confirmed cases
- `daily_deaths`: Computed daily new reported deaths

Daily counts were calculated as the difference in cumulative counts between consecutive days. Negative values (possible due to data corrections) were floored at zero using `pmax()`.

### Temporal Coverage

- The dataset spans from **March 6, 2020**, to **July 23, 2023**.
- Reporting is consistent across counties after the early months.

### County Coverage

- The dataset includes **46 counties** across South Carolina.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

**Daily New Cases:**
- Minimum daily cases: 0
- Median daily cases: 0
- Mean daily cases: 26.4
- Maximum daily cases: 10,269

**Daily New Deaths:**
- Median daily deaths: 0
- Mean daily deaths: 0.32
- Maximum daily deaths: 36

**Zero-Inflation:**
- About **54.5%** of the county-date pairs recorded **zero daily cases**, reflecting the early pandemic period and lower case counts in rural counties.

**Population Range:**
- Smallest county population: **8,688** residents
- Largest county population: **523,542** residents

### Spatial Differences

There is substantial variability in daily case counts across counties:
- The counties with the highest average daily new cases were:
  - **Greenville**: 142 cases/day
  - **Richland**: 101 cases/day
  - **Charleston**: 92.5 cases/day
- In contrast, many smaller rural counties reported much lower daily averages, often close to zero.

The top three counties — Greenville, Richland, and Charleston — are major population centers and displayed consistently higher transmission throughout the pandemic.

## Visualization

The figure below shows the time series of daily new cases for the top three counties:

These counties experienced distinct waves of COVID-19, with notable surges in late 2020, mid-2021 (Delta variant wave), and an extremely sharp spike in early 2022 (Omicron variant wave).

Charleston showed moderate levels of cases relative to Greenville and Richland, with Greenville consistently exhibiting the largest peaks in daily new cases.

## Summary

This processed dataset provides a detailed and cleaned record of COVID-19 daily incidence across South Carolina counties.  
It is appropriate for modeling epidemic dynamics, forecasting future trends, and investigating spatial heterogeneity in disease burden.

The presence of many zero-count days, large differences in county population sizes, and strong temporal waves will guide our model selection and motivate the use of flexible spline-based temporal models and spatial random effects.
